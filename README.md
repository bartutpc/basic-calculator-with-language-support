# Basic Calculator

A simple calculator written in Python while I was learning the language.

## Features
- Basic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- Input validation and ZeroDivisionError handling
- Turkish and English language support
- Option to continue or exit after a calculation is complete

## Usage
Run it from your terminal: `python calculator.py` 
- Select Language → First number → Operation → Second number → Result → Choose whether to continue → Based on your answer, either return to the first number prompt or exit

## Note
This is a simple and clear project made for learning purposes. I'm open to ideas and suggestions for improvement.
